##Flog is a Flask Blog

Flog is a small blog written with Flask. It was designed so that it could be 
extended to meet the needs of various projects.

##Setup

First you'll want to grab the project files from github. Then you'll want to
configure the project according to your needs.

Once you're satisfied with your configuration file you may use the built in
runner, `python runner.py` to check out your handy work.

Flog does except a few modules. Namely, `flask-sqlalchemy`, `flask-csrf`, 
`flask-bcrypt`, `markdown`, `wtforms` and of course `flask` itself is required.
